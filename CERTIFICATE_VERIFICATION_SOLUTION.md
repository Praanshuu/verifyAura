# Certificate Verification Issue - SOLVED

## Problem Summary
1. Backend was crashing due to port 3001 already in use
2. Certificate verification was failing even with correct certificate IDs
3. API calls from frontend were not reaching backend properly

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend Port Conflict
- Port 3001 was already in use by another process
- Backend couldn't start properly

### 2. Complex API Wrapper Issues
- The `apiFetchOptimized` function was adding unnecessary complexity
- Retry logic and caching were interfering with POST requests
- Headers were being overridden incorrectly

### 3. CORS Configuration
- Missing `credentials: true` in CORS options
- Duplicate properties in CORS configuration

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Backend Port Issue
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3001
taskkill /PID 3112 /F
```

### 2. Fixed CORS Configuration in Backend (`backend/src/index.ts`)
```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
    'http://localhost:8080',
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'https://verify-aura-frontend.vercel.app'
  ],
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With', 'X-Clerk-Auth-Token']
};
```

### 3. Fixed Backend API Query (`backend/src/routes/certificates.ts`)
- Corrected database column names to match actual schema:
  - `events.name` → `events.event_name`
  - `events.code` → `events.event_code`
  - `events.event_date` → `events.date`
  - `events.event_tag` → `events.tag`
- Added support for email-based certificate search
- Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Simplified Frontend API Call (`frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- Replaced complex `apiFetch` with direct `fetch` call
- Added better error logging and debugging
- Used direct URL instead of relying on environment variables

## Test Results

### Working Certificate IDs for Testing:
- **BWF25W1HUE9** - Pranshu Sahu's certificate
- Can also search by email addresses

### Backend API Test Endpoints:
1. **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3001/api/certificates/health`
2. **Database Test**: `http://localhost:3001/api/certificates/test`
3. **Verify Certificate**: `http://localhost:3001/api/certificates/verify`

## How to Use

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Backend should run on port 3001

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend runs on port 8080

3. **Test Certificate Verification**:
   - Go to http://localhost:8080
   - Enter certificate ID: `BWF25W1HUE9` or any valid email
   - Click "Verify Now"
   - Should display complete certificate details

## Debug Features Added (Development Mode Only)

1. **Test Button**: Pre-fills known valid certificate ID
2. **Direct API Test**: Tests API connection without wrapper
3. **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging

## Verification Flow

1. User enters certificate ID or email
2. Frontend makes direct POST request to backend
3. Backend queries database with correct column names
4. Backend returns participant data with event details
5. Frontend displays results based on certificate status

## What Works Now

✅ Certificate verification by ID
✅ Certificate verification by email
✅ Proper display of all certificate details
✅ Handling of revoked certificates
✅ Error handling for invalid certificates
✅ CORS properly configured
✅ Backend running stable on port 3001

## Important Notes

- Always ensure backend is running before testing frontend
- Check browser console for detailed debug logs
- The optimized API wrapper has been bypassed for certificate verification
- Direct fetch is more reliable for this critical endpoint
